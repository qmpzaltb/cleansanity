Cleansanity
===========

Recreating and improving the ideas of qmpzaltb/cptgame. Libraries! Time! Profanities in the code!

What Do?
  - Better/faster graphics. Using the GPU to do this (LWJGL, Processing)
  - Multiplayer support. Interports and whatnot.
  - Procedurally generated map-systems.
  - Some form of upgrading system (items, levels, skills)
  - Offloading as much as possible into easily modifiable .txt files
