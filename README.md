Cleansanity
===========

Changing Literally Everything AgainN edition.

Recreating and improving the ideas of qmpzaltb/cptgame. Libraries! Time! Profanities in the code!
But now we're starting all over again. Whee!
And then we shall start ONCE AGAIN.

"perfection stems from persistence" - qmpzaltb
"making your quote seem poignant is of utmost importance when writing poignant quotes" - qmpzaltb

This time, things will be different.
This time, commentation.
This time, a slightly better understanding of object-oriented principles.

Feature list

TODO - turn the feature list into a feature TABLE. YES.
we're doing it. (maybe)

LEGACY FEATURE LIST from oldsanity v3

(NC) - No clue how to get this to work
(NS) - Not started
(BS) - Barely started
(WIP) - Work in progress
(MC) - Mostly complete
(DONE) - Finished
(...)* - Could be better
(...)** - Needs rework

Primary Goals
  - Map generation
    - The current map generator has the tendency to create unreachable areas.
    - Also the map generator should have some sort of .txt modification to it. SCALABILITY.
  - Input
    - Mouse still needs to be done, but that should be easy (NS)
  - Graphics
    - 3D Map display
    - Heads-Up-Display GUI
    - Bind camera to entity (GLU(NS) or manual(NC)?)
    - Main menu
  - Entities
    - They should be easily moddable
  
Secondary Goals
  - Super scalability/Ease of modding/Modding API
    - Something where you can put a text file or something and BAM, new enemy.
    - Maybe some form of .jar loading system, like those fancy Minecraft mod loaders.
  - Map 'high' features
    - Fluid simulation
    - Navier-Stokes if I can even understand how it works.
  - Multiplayer support
    - Maybe use the singleplayer-server idea of Minecraft?
  - Upgrades
    - Items 
    - Levels? [Maybe scrap levels and just leave it at skills]
    - Skills [As in, you improve your individual skills rather than an arbitrary level]
  - Better graphics
    - Lighting

Super Ambitious Goals of Unattainability
  - Procedurally generated textures
    - Because pre-made textures are of the devil.
    - Also I can't make textures.
  - Entity mind-switch
    - Play as another entity, in the middle of the game. Just... switch.
  - Entity "uniqueness"
    - A more powerful dirty bubble, without needing to create a powerfuldirtybubble.txt
