Cleansanity
===========

Recreating and improving the ideas of qmpzaltb/cptgame. Libraries! Time! Profanities in the code!

Feature list (?)(!)

(NC) - No clue how to get this to work
(NS) - Not started
(BS) - Barely started
(WIP) - Work in progress
(MC) - Mostly complete
(DONE) - Finished
(...)* - Could be better
(...)** - Needs rework

Primary Goals
  - Map generation (DONE)**
    - The current map generator has the tendency to create unreachable areas.
    - Also the map generator should have some sort of .txt modification to it. SCALABILITY.
  - Input (MC)
    - Mouse still needs to be done, but that should be easy (NS)
  - Graphics
    - 3D Map display (DONE?)
    - Heads-Up-Display GUI (NS)
    - Bind camera to entity (NS)
    - Main menu (NS)
  - Entities (BS)
    - They should be easily moddable
  
Secondary Goals
  - Super scalability/Ease of modding/Modding API (NC/NS)
    - Something where you can put a text file and BAM, new enemy. (NC)
  - Map 'high' features (NS)
    - Fluid simulation (NS)
    - Navier-Stokes if I can even understand how it works. (NC)
  - Multiplayer support (NC)
    - Maybe use the singleplayer-server idea of Minecraft?
  - Upgrades (NC)
    - Items (NC)
    - Levels? (NC) [Maybe scrap levels and just leave it at skills]
    - Skills (NC) [As in, you improve your individual skills rather than an arbitrary level]
  - Better graphics
    - Lighting (NS/NC)

Super Ambitious Goals of Unattainability (NC)
  - Procedurally generated textures
    - Because pre-made textures are of the devil.
    - Also I can't make textures.
  - Entity mind-switch (NC)
    - Play as another entity, in the middle of the game. Just... switch.
  - Entity "uniqueness" (NC/NS)
    - A more powerful dirty bubble, without needing to create powerfuldirtybubble.txt
